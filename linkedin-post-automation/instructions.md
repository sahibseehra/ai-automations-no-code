## LinkedIn Post Automation Documentation
The purpose of this document is to provide a clear overview and step-by-step explanation of the Make.com automation workflow that integrates Airtable, OpenAI, Google Docs, and LinkedIn.
### Workflow Overview
This automation takes unprocessed post ideas from Airtable, generates LinkedIn content using OpenAI, logs the results in Google Docs, publishes to LinkedIn, and updates Airtable to mark completion.

## The flow ensures:
- No duplicate posts
- AI-generated content is tracked
- Posts are auto-published to LinkedIn

Airtable Integration
Airtable is a cloud-based database platform that combines the simplicity of spreadsheets with the power of relational databases.
•	It is used here as a content management system (CMS) to store LinkedIn post ideas, AI-generated drafts, and processing status.
Integration with Make.com
1.	Add the Airtable module in Make.com.
2.	Authenticate using OAuth 2.0 (recommended for security).
•	Choose Add connection → OAuth.
•	Sign in with your Airtable account.
•	Authorize Make.com to access your bases.

2.	A popup will appear asking you to connect your Google Account.
3.	Click Continue and log in with the Google account where your Google Docs files are stored.
4.	Review the list of permissions (Make.com needs access to read/write your Google Drive and Docs).
5.	Click Allow to grant access.

## Verify and Save

## 3. End-to-End Flow Diagram
The automation flow is:
 
1. Airtable (Search Records) 
2. Tools (Set Variables)
3. OpenAI (Generate Post) 
4. Router
   Path 1: Save to Google Docs
   Path 2: Publish to LinkedIn → Update Airtable (is_processed = TRUE)

## 4. Key Benefits
- Hands-free posting → Content is created and published automatically
- Central tracking → Google Docs acts as a historical log
- Error prevention → Airtable flag avoids duplicate posting
- Scalable → Can handle multiple entries at once with the router
